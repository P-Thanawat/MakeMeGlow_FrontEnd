              copyright law. It is our policy, in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, to disable and/or
              terminate the accounts of users who repeatedly infringe or are repeatedly charged with infringing the
              copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that your work has been copied
              and posted on the Website in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our copyright
              agent with the following information: an electronic or physical signature of the copyright owner or of the
              person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; a description of the
              copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed; a description of where the material that you claim is
              infringing is located on the Website; your address, telephone number, and e-mail address; a written
              statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the
              copyright owner, its agent, or the law; a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above
              information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on
              the copyright owner's behalf. Any notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act on such
              copyright owner’s behalf that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered
              sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon us actual knowledge of facts or circumstances
              from which infringing material or acts are evident. Our copyright agent for notice of claims of copyright
              infringement can be reached by writing to Legal Department, Shiseido Americas Corporation, 390 Madison

              parent, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, representatives, and

              reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from any violation of these Terms and Conditions by you. We reserve
              the right to assume, at our sole expense, the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to
              indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with us in asserting any available
              defenses. This provision does not require you to indemnify us for any unconscionable commercial practice
              by such party or for such party’s fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or concealment,
              suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with the Website.

              <br />
              14. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY THE WEBSITE IS PRESENTED “AS IS.” WE MAKE NO

              AND CONDITIONS OR THE WEBSITE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
              NON-INFRINGEMENT OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND
              WARRANTIES ARE NOT LEGALLY EXCLUDABLE. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR TIMELINESS, ACCURACY, UNAVAILABILITY OR
              INTERRUPTIONS IN AVAILABILITY, VIRUSES OR OTHER DEFECTS IN THE WEBSITE OR ITS CONTENTS. IN NO EVENT WILL
              WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND
              (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) RELATED TO THE SITE REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR
              OTHERWISE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR MAXIMUM
              AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THESE DISCLAIMERS
              AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY DO NOT EXCLUDE ANY PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, STATUTORY CONSUMER RIGHTS,
              DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH PERSONAL INJURY OR RESULTING FROM COMPANY INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, RECKLESSNESS,
              FRAUD, OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE. THE TERMS IN THIS SECTION ARE VALID ONLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
              LAW.
              <br />
              <br />
              15. JURISDICTION; ARBITRATION AGREEMENT PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT
              YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. IT
              CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER. WE BOTH AGREE TO
              ARBITRATE: You and MMG Cosmetics agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms and Conditions
              through final and binding arbitration, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or
              threatened to violate our intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright,
              or patent rights). Under such circumstances we may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop
              unauthorized use or abuse of the Website, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark,
              trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal
              dispute-resolution process described above. WHAT IS ARBITRATION: Arbitration is more informal than a
              lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will
              be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court
              can. If any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision
              shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced. ARBITRATION PROCEDURES: The
              Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision.
              Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating
              to these Terms and Conditions shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance
              with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in front of one arbitrator. If there is a
              conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms and Conditions, the rules set forth in
              these Terms and Conditions will govern. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration
              are available from JAMS at http://www.jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267. To initiate arbitration, you or we
              must do the following things: (1) Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of
              the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for
              Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com. (2) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate
              filing fee to: JAMS to your local JAMS office or to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San
              Francisco, CA 94111. (3) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party. Payment of all
              filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. If travelling to New York
              is a burden, you may participate in the arbitration by phone or via document submission to the fullest
              extent allowable by the arbitrator. Each party will bear their own costs of arbitration unless the
              arbitrator directs that bearing such costs would be an undue burden and in that case, we will pay for your
              portion of the arbitration administrative costs (but not your attorneys’ fees). Arbitration under this
              Arbitration Agreement shall be held in the United States in New York, NY under New York law without regard
              to its conflict of laws provisions. The arbitration may award on an individual basis the same damages and
              relief as a court (including injunctive relief). Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may
              be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR: The arbitrator will decide the
              rights and liabilities, if any, of you and MMG Cosmetics, and the dispute will not be consolidated with
              any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to
              grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award
              monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under
              applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and these Terms and Conditions. The arbitrator shall issue a
              written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the
              award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to
              award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator
              is final and binding upon you and us. NO CLASS ACTIONS: You may only resolve disputes with us on an
              individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or
              representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and
              consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL: THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE
              THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY,
              instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are
              typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to
              very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and us in any state
              or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND MMG Cosmetics
              WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU
              ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS
              ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. OPT-OUT OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT: You can decline this Arbitration Agreement by
              emailing us at adroptout@sac.shiseido.com and providing the requested information as follows: (1)Your
              Name; (2) the URL to these Terms and Conditions; (3) Your Address; (4) Your Phone Number; (5) and clear
              statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision in the Terms of Conditions. The Opt-Out
              Notice must be emailed no later than 30 days after the date you first accept the Terms and Conditions by
              using the Website. CHOICE OF LAW/FORUM SELECTION: In any circumstances where this Arbitration Agreement
              permits the parties to litigate in court, these Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of New
              York as if the Terms and Conditions were a contract wholly entered into and wholly performed within New
              York. You further expressly consent and agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of (i) a
              state court of competent jurisdiction located in New York County, New York, or (ii) the United State
              District Court for the Southern District of New York.

              in Supply Chain Act went into effect in California. This act requires retail sellers and manufacturers
              doing business in California to disclose the efforts made to ensure its supply chains are free from
              slavery and human trafficking in effort to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from product supply
              chains. MMG Cosmetics is committed to being responsible in its global business practices and takes steps
              with its product suppliers to ensure compliance with MMG Cosmetics’ standards of conduct as set forth in
              Shiseido Group Supplier Code of Conduct, of which MMG Cosmetics is a part, and all applicable laws. MMG
              Cosmetics has made the following efforts to ensure compliance by its product suppliers: Certification: MMG
              Cosmetics requires all product suppliers to confirm in writing that they understand and will adhere to the
              Shiseido Group Supplier Code of Conduct. The Shiseido Group Supplier Code of Conduct specifically requires
              product suppliers to certify that all goods are manufactured in compliance with the wage and hour, slavery
              and human trafficking laws of the country of manufacture and without the use of children or prison,
              indentured, exploited, bonded, forced or slave labor. Training: The Shiseido Group’s global procurement
              and supply chain management teams are trained on the Shiseido Group Supplier Code of Conduct and how to
              identify possible indicators of human trafficking and slavery in the supply chain to ensure that no risk
              factors are present. Audits & Verification: MMG Cosmetics’ global procurement and supply chain management
              teams have the ability to audit product suppliers either itself or conduct an independent third party
              assessment, including conducting on-site inspections to assess factory conditions and ensure that
              management is not in violation of slavery and human-trafficking laws. Accountability: MMG Cosmetics will
              not do business with any supplier who will not agree to comply with the Shiseido Global Supplier Code of
              Conduct or its other accountability standards. MMG Cosmetics will issue a warning to any supplier,
              employee or contractor who willfully or knowingly fails to comply with these standards and, if the
              supplier, employee, or contractor fails to take prompt corrective action, MMG Cosmetics will enforce
              disciplinary action including termination of the business relationship. MMG Cosmetics is dedicated to
              conducting its business with integrity and the highest standard of ethics and seeks the same level of
              integrity and ethical standards with its vendor and supplier partners. MMG Cosmetics will continue to
              assess all risks and opportunities to ensure that its approach will prevent any injustice or violation of
              human rights within its supply chain.
